        <h2>HTML, CSS and DOM</h2>
        <p>
          I love using analogies to explain things. To explain HTML, CSS and DOM and they way they interact together, I will use an analogy. Think of these 3 components as being a human being. Lets say HTML is like your skeleton and muscular frame, CSS would be you all of your physical attributes, your sensory organs and how you outwardly appear to others. DOM would be your brain, which through signals passed through your body, it ultimately dictates how your frame and communicates with your sensory organs to do things.

        <h2>Boxifying design</h2>
        <p>
          Boxifying design is a term used to describe a design format where everything is broken up into boxes. some boxes may have 1 or many boxes inside them and even inside those inner boxes (like a Russian doll). Boxes contain all content including images, text and everything else.
        </p>
        <h2>The box model</h2>
        <p>
          The CSS box model is the format that the boxes within a website all follow. These boxes, from the outside in, contain the following elements; margin, border, padding, then finally the content.
