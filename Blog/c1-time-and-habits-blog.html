      After viewing the various different techniques on time-management and habit forming, I ended up a little confused to be honest. I tried the Pomodoro technique to read/view all the material but couldn't quite get through it all.

      I did find it very interesting that there are quite conflicting approaches to this and decided that perhaps a more 'left-field' approach might work best for me.

      I am going to try the Fogg techniques on habit building and some of the techniques from the Counterintuitive Productivity blog. While the idea of Meditation is a little foreign to me, I'm also keen to try this out and see how it may benefit me.
