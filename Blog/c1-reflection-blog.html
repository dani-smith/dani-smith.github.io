          <h2>Reflections on "Shereef's Fireside Chat" </h2>
          <p>05 June 2018</p>
                    
          <p>
            From listening to Shereef's Fireside Chat, my take on EDA has not changed much from what I had thought based on reading through EDA's values and from what I have learnt from speaking to the people there. I guess this just reinforced the idea's that I had come to myself.
          </p>
          <p>
            My impressions of this learning environment fostered by EDA is very much one of inclusivity, experimentation and the willingness to utilise the range of skills and ideas that various different people may bring to the table. Rather than what often seems to me as a 'box ticking' exercise in relation to inclusion and diversity, EDA appear to actually walk the walk with how this is approached.
          </p>
          <p>
            One thing that listening to this chat has given me is a bit more confidence. Shereef speaks on a very relatable level and shares the potential struggles that you may come across. A specific thing that resonated with me was the 'team sport' analogy. I've been involved in many team sports over the years and love working in a team, tapping into each members potential and having buy-in from all members to create something unique together. This is a culture I'm very excited to be a part of.
          </p>
          <p>
            My expectations have not changed as such however there is slight relief in hearing that everyone comes across struggles and it won't be just me!
          </p>
          <p>
            I am very excited about getting stuck in to this challenge and meeting fellow teammates however I am very nervous about suceeding in this great opportunity.
