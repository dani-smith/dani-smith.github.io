        <h1>T5 - Problem Solving</h1>
        <p>05 July 2018</p>

        <p>
          Over the past few lessons I have come across a range of problems, mostly to do with code not working and with little or no knowledge as to why. The hardest part is actually defining the problem you are trying to solve. This can be quite tough but with a process of elimination, you can generally define the actual issue. Once the issue is established, you can work on some troubleshooting steps to try to solve it. I genuinely love problem solving - got a cryptic crossword or a Rubick's cube? Hand it over!

        <h2>My Problem</h2>
        <p>
          One problem I ran into whilst doing the 'game' part of sprint 5 was trying to get the total count working properly for the coloured circles. The totals were getting a count, but not the correct one, with every click the total was returning numbers that went up in weird increments (1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 27 etc.). I figured out the pattern (it was adding a number of 1 higher than the previous time with each click). I checked the code I had changed within the updateCounts function against other students code and it seemed to look OK comparatively. I discovered that I had the written code above the totals variable, so it wasn't properly counting. I moved the code around to the correct place to execute in order and it worked :). I felt slightly frustrated while working through this without any success (while using some trial and error editing), but I learnt that it's not a bad thing to look at others code to make sure you understand it and to get yours working. Maybe I'll try not to be so stubborn next time before trying this.

        <h2>Problem Solving Techniques</h2>
        <p>
          There are a number of problem solving techniques available. Being a natural problem solver (I guess) I've never really thought about the process in which I problem solve but it's most like a check-list, which has a hierachy of intricacies and things get checked off from the most broad, to the nitty gritty. I'm meant to be reflecting on different problem solving techniques but most of them I havent actually tried. I am interested in the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging>'Rubber Ducky'</a> method, which, as defined by Wikipedia is where "A programmer would carry around a rubber duck and debug their code by forcing themselves to explain it, line-by-line, to the duck". I'm definitely keen on trying that. I should also probably try console.logging and Pseudocode when I have a better understanding of it.

          Things I do like to do is GOOGLING (who doesn't love Googling?). It is literally how I learn anything about anything these days. I definitely use google a lot, especially using google with error messages to help define problems. Aside from trying a few different things on my own, googling is my go to. On the odd occasion that google fails me, I am happy to reach out to my peers. This is especially useful in phase 0 as everyone is doing the same thing as you (or has already done). I like to talk over issues with people to make sure I fully understand the 'why' of it, so in that respect it can be more valuable than Google. Sometime even after I've used Google to solve a problem, I'll still reach out to discuss it with someone to make sure I'm fully understanding it. This can be very useful and I think I should make an effort to try to do this every time it is possible to.
