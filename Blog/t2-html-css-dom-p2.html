    <h3>Grid based design</h3>
    <p>
      Grid based design is a design format used to lay content out to work with the pattern our eyes naturally follow when viewing content. Grid based design is commonly used in print media like newspapers and magazines as well as websites.

    <h3>Responsive webpages</h3>
    <p>
      Creating content with responsive design is an important part of making sure your webpage is viewed in the not only a legible way but a way that is user friendly and lays out in a way that works with the pattern our eyes naturally follow. Responsive design seems more important in this current age not only as hardware technology develops and there are more devices to accomodate but also as websites have gone from being static pages to having more and more interactive features.

    <h3>Semantic Structure</h3>
    <p>
      Semantic structure describes a web page laid out a way where the sections have a hirachy and tags that describe them in a meaningful way. Having semantic structure by using semantic tags is important not only for search engine optimisation but for web accessibility reasons.
