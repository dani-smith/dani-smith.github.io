        <h1>T3 - Design to Web</h1>

        <h2>Responsiveness</h2>
        <p>
          Responsive websites are sites that are responsive to any environment they're being displayed in. With the ever-growing use of tablets and mobile phones for browsing, responsiveness is important to ensure a smooth end-user experience and making sure all of the hard work put into the visual elements of design is not done in vain. 
        </p>
        <h2>Mobile first design</h2>
        <p>
          Mobile first design is basically basing your design on a mobile smartphone display format and working your way up to tablet, and desktop size formats. As mentioned above, mobile browsing is becoming ever popular so it is important to accomodate for that. It's also the easiest process to work with to ensure a responsive end product.
        </p>
        <h2>Frameworks</h2>
        <p>
          Frameworks are basically pre-written code that you can use to implement responsiveness and design structure on top of many other things so you dont have to 'reinvent the wheel' so to speak. There are MANY available frameworks available online that are easy to implement along with your own code so it's a very useful tool. I guess the downsides could be that if you're using these as well as writing your own code you have to look out for conflicting rules within the code to make sure things appear as you mean them to. 
        </p>
        <h2>Wireframes</h2>
        <p>
          Wireframes are drawn designs of the way you'd like your page(s) to appear structurally. You draw these up using your <a href="t2-html-css-dom-p1.html">boxifying</a> design. Drawing up wireframes are an important part of the design process as you need this to begin to structure your page.

        <p>I really struggled with CSS and getting to implement most aspects of it to be honest. There was a LOT of trial and error but I feel like I have a much better handle on it now.</p>
