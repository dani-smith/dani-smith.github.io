          <h2>C2 - Emotional intelligence</h2>

          <h2>Search Inside Yourself</h2>
          <p>
            The first chapter of the book Search Inside Yourself is certainly interesting. Of particular interest to me were the neurological studies that had been done to test theories about emotional intelligence I learned the 3 ways in which it can directly improve your output in a work environment. I think the most interesting part for me was the connection to physiology and the parts about intuition coming from the basal ganglia and explaining the term 'gut feeling'.

          <h2>Mindfulness</h2>
          <p>
            I tried the two minutes of 'mindfulness' and to be honest, this is not something that is easy for me. Funnily enough, I tried the 'easy' version as that's the version where you focus on your breathing. The 'easier' version is where you have to focus on nothing and I have never been able to shut my brain off and focus on nothing so naturally the switch in attention to focus on breathing is much easier for me.
