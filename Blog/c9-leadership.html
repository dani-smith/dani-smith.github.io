        <h1>C9 - Leadership</h1>
        <p>01 August 2018</p>

        <h2>My experience of compassionate (or not) leadership</h2>
        <p>
          Compassionate leadership is an interesting concept and possibly not one encountered very often by myself. It's interesting to see the data that supports compassionate leaders as more effective leaders. I have spent the past almost 10 years playing roller derby (a full contact sport played on roller skates) and have over the years been a part of many teams with various different leadership styles, as well as holding several leadership positions myself. One thing I always held as necessary to running an effective team is having team buy-in. It's one thing to set some common goals on achieving certain wins for the season but quite another on getting buy-in from the team on every aspect, from training to team culture. One thing I did to get buy-in was to assign everyone a role in the team, somewhat to take some of the management pressures off myself, but also to make sure everyone has a valuable role on and off the track that is contributing to running the team they're part of. While my teams never did particularly well on the track (won some, lost some), one thing I was always proud of is that everyone enjoyed themselves, whether it be winning or losing together and I feel this side came from compassionate leadership.

        <h2>Multiplying goodness and Tonglen meditation</h2>
        <p>
          I tried both of these meditation exercises but found them both to be somewhat difficult. I have a lot of experience with visualisation from 8 years of gymnastics as a child and nearly 10 years of roller derby and the truth is, I hate it. I find it very hard to control my visualisation and my brain weasels always manage to hijack it.

        <h2>The SCARF model and my Phase 0 experience</h2>
        <p>
          I liked the explaination of the SCARF model, which stands for Status, Certainty, Autonomy, Relatedness and Fairness. I'm not sure how I would relate to all of these things through my experience during phase 0 but one thing that really stands out is certainty. Lack of certainty for me has definitely negatively impacted me in some ways, whether it's lack of certainty in my ability to understand concepts or being uncertain about my discipline to complete tasks on my own, it has certainly seen me shy away from pushing on through and completing things, which is kind of ironic.

        <h2>Having a difficult conversation with myself</h2>
        <p>
          Hated it.
