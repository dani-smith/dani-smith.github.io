        <h1>C8 - Connecting</h1>
        <p>30 July 2018</p>

        <h2>Insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity</h2>
        <p>
          I'm not sure exactly which part this is referring to but one part I would like to reflect on which was of particular interest to me was the 'The Five Dysfunctions of a Team' section. This was particularly interesting for me as I could really identify with the issues outlined here in the setting of my previous roller derby team. One which brings people from all walks of life together which I was involved in for nearly 10 years and have seen many ups and downs with. I could strongly relate to the outlined issues that can cause disfunction due to lack of trust.
        </p>
        <h2>Empathic listening and loving kindness</h2>
        <p>
          I read through the empathetic listening and oving kindness techniques in chapter 8 which include the exercises to perform. As I was alone, I couldn't practice the empathetic listening though I did try the loving kindness exercise which I could do on my own. I felt a calm sensation upon completion of this exercise though I'm not entirely sure if this was mostly just from getting into a state of mindfulness to do this.
        </p>
        <h2>'Political Awareness' exercise</h2>
        <p>
          I am not comfortable publishing the scenario I used for this exercise, so I'm not going to. However, I will say I found this exercise insightful and meaningful.
