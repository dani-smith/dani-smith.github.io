        <h2>Mindfulness and Self Awareness</h2>
        <p>
          The way that I understand the description of self awareness in this chapter and how it goes with mindfulness is that they kind of go hand in hand. I really liked this analogy used in chapter four which says: "The traditional analogy of this mind is a fluttering flag on a flagpole. The flag represents the mind. In the presence of strong emotions, the mind may be turbulent like a flag fluttering violently in the wind. The flagpole represents mindfulness—it keeps the mind steady and grounded despite all that emotional movement. This stability is what allows us to view ourselves with third-person objectivity". I guess that it is with mindfulness that you can improve your self-awareness with an objective mind.

        <h2>Body Scanning and Journaling</h2>
        <p>
          I tried both of the 'body scan' and 'journaling' exercises. Journaling is something I have done before. Both exercises gave me a calming sensation and a sense of letting go. However, only the body scan gave me an actual physical sensation to accompany this which ran down my back, so that was interesting. Now, I'm off to burn the bit of paper I wrote on for journaling.

        <h2>My Emotions are Not Me</h2>
        <p>
          I found the section "my emotions are not me" to be particularly interesting. I think it's easy to get wrapped up in identifying as your emotions which must mean letting them have control over you. I really liked this quote from the book about that: "Thoughts and emotions are like clouds—some beautiful, some dark—while our core being is like the sky. Clouds are not the sky; they are phenomena in the sky that come and go. Similarly, thoughts and emotions are not who we are; they are simply phenomena in mind and body that come and go" .
