        <h2>The Pleasure, Passion and Purpose Lens</h2>
        <p>
          Breaking down thinking through the pleasure, passion and purpose lens as a way of self motivation is an interesting concept. I am definitely a pleasure driven person with a need for semi-instant gratification (typical millenial). The idea of finding your higher purpose certainly peaked my interest however. I often find it very hard to look into what I want in the future and to therefore set goals but taking a step back further than just thinking about what you want to be doing and thinking about what you'd like you purpose to be seems to be a good way to narrow and identify where you'd actually like to be.

        <p>
          I enjoyed doing the higher purpose exercise focussing on writing down core values and what I stand for, which is not something I think of often. One thing that surprised me after writing and while reviewing my writings was how positive everything that was written was. I tend to think of myself as a somewhat pessimistic type, so it was interesting to reflect on.

        <h2>Resilience Ideas and Meditation</h2>
        <p>
          I think something I mentioned in my last blog is that I find it difficult to recreate previous emotional feelings in a superficial environment however this time was less difficult. I used recent examples both relating to experiences while doing phase 0 at EDA to channel feelings of success and failure and I managed to get a far better reflective response.
