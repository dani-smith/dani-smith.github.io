        <h1>C3 - Meditation Process</h1>

        <h2>Process over Product</h2>
        <p>
          While re-designing my site over the last two days I really had to keep in mind the process over product idea. I think that keeping aware of this idea is very important as it's quite easy to get caught up with the product side of things especially when you can see something visually as being instantly rewarding. I suceeded in being mindful of this and spent alot of time familiarising myself with elements in CSS and learnt a lot by troubleshooting and identifying issues, which is an important part of the process.

        <h2>Reflections on Search Inside Yourself, chapter 2</h2>
        <p>
          Prior to reading chapter 2 of Search Inside Yourself, I still had the idea of meditation as being for hippies and "alternative therapy" administrators. At heart, I am a bit of a skeptic, particularly about things that aren't conclusively scientifically provable. Naturally, the scientific studies portion of this chapter intrigued me, while I'm still skeptical about some of the "findings", it did surprise me to learn that many controlled scientific studies had been conducted.

        <p>
          One thing I really liked learning about meditation from this chapter is that there's really no hard and fast rules and therefore no real way of doing it wrong. Personally, I'd definitely need to focus on maintaining attention better but I liked the ideas of acknowledging distractions (my mind wanders alot) and dealing with them while meditating, rather than beating yourself up for not being able to maintain attention, and that that in itself is useful.

          Finally, the last point I found of particular interest was the study in which they concluded that participation in mindfulness meditation can greatly accelerate the healing of Psoriasis. I have suffered from Psoriasis myself for over 10 years and have tried most available forms of treatment (aside from moving to the meditteranean, as suggested by one specialist, helpful huh) so naturally this peaked my interest. I'm unsure of the actual treatment that was being used in this situation though. When I read that part out to my mum she looked at me with the smuggest of smiles, as if it justified all her nagging of me to try "alternative treatments" over the years.
