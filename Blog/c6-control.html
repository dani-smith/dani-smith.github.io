        <h2>Emotional Triggers</h2>
        <p>
          I am a somewhat high-stress person in a lot of ways and stress can very easily trigger an emotional response for myself. When coding I think the stress of not being able to work something out within what I think of as a reasonable amount of time definitely triggers an unwarranted emotional response. This response generally comes in the form of a verbal outburst and a desire to quit what I am doing.

        <h2>Siberian North Railroad Exercise</h2>
        <p>
          I found this exercise interesting though found it tough to try to shift to a negative emotion in an unreal environment, I'll have to try again when I am actually angry at something, haha.
