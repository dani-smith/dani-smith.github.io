        <h2>Javascript compared to HTML and CSS</h2>
        <p>
          Javascript is a very different beast to HTML and CSS, much like HTML and CSS differ from eachother. Where HTML is used to construct the basic structure of the page and input content and CSS used to design how the page visually looks, Javascript controls the interactions of a website. 
        </p>
        <h2>Control flow and loops</h2>
        <p>
          Loops are used to run through tasks set out until a condition returns false. I'll use cooking as an analogy, you have all of your ingredients laid out to make a curry, say. The end result would be to add everything into the pot, first would be your base, probably onions, ginger, garlic, once those are in, it'll run down to the next things you have to add, like your dry spices. It'll keep prompting you to add ingredients in the order set out until there are no ingredients left to add. Control flow would be used to lay out the order in which you want things added to the pot.
        </p>
        <h2>Accessing data from arrays and objects</h2>
        <p>
          Arrays are lists of data in which each item in the list is assigned with a number, starting from 0 (inclusive) so you use these assigned numbers to access the data. Objects are more commonly used for storing data with properties and I cannot remember how to aceess these :/. I'll update this when I do remember.
        </p>
        <h2>Functions</h2>
        <p>
          Functions are set out scripts used to execute tasks when they are called, They are useful to use so you dont have to write out the code manually to execute a task.
