          I didn't actually practice the 'mindful conversation' cause I didn't have anyone to talk to but I imagined it and it went OK, haha. I'm sure it's a great technique to use to manage difficult situations like mediation but in everyday conversation, it kind of weirds me out.

          I haven't really committed to practicing this so I can't really commit to including a certain technique in mindfulness practice. Maybe I'm just cynical today. Though I am going to try a bit harder to pay more attention to what people around me are saying. To be honest when I read about that it just really made me mad at my Mum cause she doesn't often give her full attention. This is turning a bit rambly and off topic so I best leave that here. Sorry, this is terrible.
